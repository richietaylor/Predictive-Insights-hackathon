Limitations of Survey Data:
 	- "Home" language does not necessarily refer to English
		- e.g. To a black African Zulu could be a home language and English an addtional language
	- suggestion: take addtion language and create bool of matric level in any language (or failed)
		 - "1" = pass, "0" = fail,  "" = no data/no education

Maths & Maths Lit:
	- combine Maths and Maths Lit and use bool to work out if math edu or not

Scarring:
	- work out using tenue + age
